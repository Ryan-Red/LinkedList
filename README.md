# LinkedList
This Code is meant to generate a linked list node, that has both a forward and backwards attribute, instead of just a "next attribute".

In the future, there will be an all-encompassing structure called the Linked List, which will do all of the linked list nodes operations
under the hood.

This code is still very basic, but I plan to keep working on it often to make it a viable Linked List structure!
